SDLC-STLC
SDLC - Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software.

SDLC Phases (Step-by-Step)
1. Planning â€“ Decide what the software should do and whether it's possible to build it.
2. Requirement Analysis â€“ Gather details on what the software needs (features, performance, security, etc.).
3. Design â€“ Create a blueprint for how the software will be structured and how different parts will work together.
4. Development (Coding) â€“ Programmers write the actual code based on the design.
5. Testing â€“ Testers check for bugs, errors, and if the software works as expected.
6. Deployment â€“ Release the software for users to use.
7. Maintenance â€“ Fix any issues and update the software as needed.

Document required in the each stage of SDLC
1. Planning Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Project Proposal â€“ Defines the purpose, scope, and objectives of the software.
Feasibility Study Report â€“ Evaluates technical, financial, and operational feasibility.
Risk Assessment Report â€“ Identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies.
Project Plan â€“ Outlines timelines, resources, and budget allocation.
   
3. Requirement Analysis Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Business Requirement Document (BRD) â€“ High-level business needs and goals.
Software Requirement Specification (SRS) â€“ Detailed functional & non-functional requirements.
Use Cases/User Stories â€“ Describes how users interact with the system.
Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) â€“ Maps requirements to test cases for validation.
   
3. Design Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
High-Level Design (HLD) â€“ Architectural design, modules, components, and technologies used.
Low-Level Design (LLD) â€“ Detailed design of individual modules, including logic, database design, and API specifications.
UI/UX Design Documents â€“ Wireframes, prototypes, and screen flows.
Database Design Document â€“ ER diagrams, schema definitions.
   
5. Development Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Source Code Documentation â€“ Explanation of code structure, functions, and logic.
API Documentation â€“ Details of APIs, endpoints, parameters, and responses.
Version Control Report â€“ Tracks changes made in code repositories (e.g., Git).
   
5. Testing Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Test Plan â€“ Strategy, scope, testing approach, tools, and schedule.
Test Cases/Test Scripts â€“ Detailed test cases, inputs, expected outputs, and steps.
Test Execution Report â€“ Summary of test execution and results.
Defect Report/Bug Tracker â€“ List of identified defects, severity, and status.
   
7. Deployment Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Release Notes â€“ Features, bug fixes, known issues in the release.
Deployment Guide â€“ Steps for installation and setup.
Rollback Plan â€“ Steps to revert in case of issues.
   
7. Maintenance Phase
ðŸ“„ Documents:
Incident Report â€“ Details of issues encountered after deployment.
Change Request Document (CRD) â€“ Requests for modifications or enhancements.
System Monitoring Report â€“ Logs and performance metrics for ongoing maintenance.
